Historically the commercial capital of Canada, Montreal was surpassed in population and in economic strength by Toronto in the 1970s.[28] It remains an important centre of commerce, aerospace, transport, finance, pharmaceuticals, technology, design, education, art, culture, tourism, food, fashion, video game development, film, and world affairs. Montreal has the second-highest number of consulates in North America,[29] serves as the location of the headquarters of the International Civil Aviation Organization, and was named a UNESCO City of Design in 2006.[30][31]
 In 2017, Montreal was ranked the 12th-most liveable city in the world by the Economist Intelligence Unit in its annual Global Liveability Ranking,[32] although it slipped to rank 40 in the 2021 index, primarily due to stress on the healthcare system from the COVID-19 pandemic.[33] It is regularly ranked as a top ten city in the world to be a university student in the QS World University Rankings.[34]

Montreal has hosted multiple international conferences and events, including the 1967 International and Universal Exposition and the 1976 Summer Olympics.[35][36] It is the only Canadian city to have held the Summer Olympics. In 2018, Montreal was ranked as a global city.[37] The city hosts the Canadian Grand Prix of Formula One since 1978,[38] as well as the Montreal International Jazz Festival,[39] the largest jazz festival in the world,[40] the Just for Laughs festival, the largest comedy festival in the world,[41] and Les Francos de Montréal, which is the largest event devoted exclusively to French-language music anywhere in the world.[42] It is also home to ice hockey team Montreal Canadiens, the franchise with the most Stanley Cup wins. 
European settlers from La Flèche in the Loire valley first named their new town, founded in 1642, Ville Marie ("City of Mary"),[14] named for the Virgin Mary.[44] Its current name comes from Mount Royal,[15] the triple-peaked hill in the heart of the city. According to one theory, the name derives from mont Réal, (Mont Royal in modern French, although in 16th-century French the forms réal and royal were used interchangeably); 
Cartier's 1535 diary entry, naming the mountain, refers to le mont Royal.[45] One of Cartier's officers was Claude de Pontbriand, lord of the Château de Montréal,[46] in the Occitan-speaking part of France. The toponym Montréal and its reversed form Réalmont, the direct Occitan translation of French mont royal (or royal mont), are common in southern France. 
One possibility, noted by the government of Canada on its website concerning Canadian place names, speculates that the name as it is currently written originated when an early map of 1556 used the Italian name of the mountain, Monte Real;[47] the Commission de toponymie du Québec has dismissed this idea as a misconception.[45]
As part of the American Revolution, the invasion of Quebec resulted after Benedict Arnold captured Fort Ticonderoga in present-day upstate New York in May 1775 as a launching point to Arnold's invasion of Quebec in September. While Arnold approached the Plains of Abraham, Montreal fell to American forces led by Richard Montgomery on November 13, 1775, after it was abandoned by Guy Carleton.
 After Arnold withdrew from Quebec City to Pointe-aux-Trembles on November 19, Montgomery's forces left Montreal on December 1 and arrived there on December 3 to plot to attack Quebec City, with Montgomery leaving David Wooster in charge of the city. Montgomery was killed in the failed attack and Arnold, who had taken command, sent Brigadier General Moses Hazen to inform Wooster of the defeat. 
Montreal is in the southwest of the province of Quebec. The city covers most of the Island of Montreal at the confluence of the Saint Lawrence and Ottawa Rivers. The port of Montreal lies at one end of the Saint Lawrence Seaway, the river gateway that stretches from the Great Lakes to the Atlantic.[80] Montreal is defined by its location between the Saint Lawrence river to its south and the Rivière des Prairies to its north.
 The city is named after the most prominent geographical feature on the island, a three-head hill called Mount Royal, topped at 232 m (761 ft) above sea level.[81]
